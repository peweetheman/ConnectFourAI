# Connect Four AI
## Patrick Phillips

![](connect-4.png)

This project creates connect-4 AI players using a minimax tree search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and other added heuristics (favoring the middle, favoring having rows of 2, 3). There are different settings for the AI player that can be used, and the AI player can play on different sized boards. The project uses a simple text interface.
